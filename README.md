# 💳 Credit Risk Model

Welcome to the **Credit Risk Model** repository! 🚀  
This project is designed to help financial institutions assess and predict the risk associated with lending to borrowers using advanced machine learning techniques and an intuitive web interface.

---

## 🌟 Features

- **Interactive Dashboard:** User-friendly Streamlit interface for credit risk prediction.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Estimates probability of default, credit score, and risk rating from borrower data.
- **Automated Feature Engineering:** Calculates ratios and transforms input data for model compatibility.
- **Customizable Inputs:** Enter borrower demographics, financial, and loan-related information.
- **Easy Deployment:** Ready to use locally or on the cloud.

## 🧐 How It Works

1. **Input Details:** Enter borrower attributes such as age, income, loan amount, credit utilization, delinquency ratios, and account details.
2. **Get Predictions:** Instantly view predicted default probability, credit score, and risk rating.
